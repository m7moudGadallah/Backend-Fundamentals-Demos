# Server Sent Events (SSE)

## Overview

Server Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that allows a server to push data to a web page over a single, long-lived connection. This technology is a great fit for applications that require real-time updates from a server, such as social media feeds, news tickers, or stock tickers.

## Demo

This demo shows a simple example of Server Sent Events in action. By building a simple weather monitoring system, we can see how Server Sent Events can be used to check for weather updates and receive them in real-time.

To run the demo, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

**2. Navigate to the `server-sent-events` folder:**

```bash
cd communication-patterns/server-sent-events
```

**3. Install the dependencies:**

```bash
yarn install
```

**4. Run the server:**

```bash
yarn start
```

**5. Follow postman collection to test the API:**
