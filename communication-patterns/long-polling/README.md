# Long Polling Communication Pattern

## Overview

Long polling is a communication pattern used in web development to simulate server push. It is a technique used to keep a connection open between the client and the server for a long period of time, allowing the server to push data to the client whenever it is available.

## Demo

This demo shows a simple example of long polling in action. By building a simple sensor monitoring system, we can see how long polling can be used to check for sensor updates and receive them in real-time.

To run the demo, follow these steps:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

**2. Navigate to the `long-polling` folder:**

```bash
cd communication-patterns/long-polling
```

**3. Install the dependencies:**

```bash
yarn install
```

**4. Run the server:**

```bash
yarn start
```

**5. Follow postman collection to test the API:**
